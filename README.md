# ScroogeCoin
ScroogeCoin is a cryptocurrency that aims to implement an append-only ledger that creates secure transactions between users. <br> <br>
ScroogeCoin is a centralized cryptocurrency, which means that the main Scrooge class that creates coins and approves transactions has more power over any of the users.  This is not ideal because no one entity should hold that much power. For example, Scrooge can choose if it does not want to approve perfectly valid transactions, which defeats the purpose of cryptocurrencies. <br> <br>
ScroogeCoin is a learning step to understand why decentralization is important in cryptocurrencies, and demonstrates how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin solve this problem. <br> <br>
This repo demonstrates an implementation of ScroogeCoin. Transactions are created by users, validated by Scrooge, added to the blockchain by Scrooge, and then processed.
